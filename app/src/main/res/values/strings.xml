    <string name="About">Our team is aiming to develop Catch your Meal, a mobile application that will enable
students to create customisable meal plans and have them delivered to their
doorsteps.
Ethnic food will be prepared in a dedicated kitchen, and delivered to the studentsâ€™
residences. Students will be able to create lunch and dinner meal plans by selecting
dishes from a wide range of South Asian dishes. Student will be able to select delivery
dates and times and change them within a reasonable time before delivery.</string>
